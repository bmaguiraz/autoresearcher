## Experiment Details
- **Issue:** MOR-64 - Autoresearch: 03-data-cleaning --cycles 2
- **Session ID:** 994bab4d
- **Branch:** `autoresearch/MOR-64-994bab4d`
- **Date:** 2026-03-18
- **Cycles:** 2

## Results Summary

### Performance
| Metric | Baseline | Final | Change |
|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| **Composite Score** | **100.0** | **100.0** | **0.0** |
| Type Correctness | 25.0 | 25.0 | 0.0 |
| Null Handling | 25.0 | 25.0 | 0.0 |
| Deduplication | 25.0 | 25.0 | 0.0 |
| Outlier Treatment | 25.0 | 25.0 | 0.0 |

### Outcome
- ✅ Maintained perfect score of 100.0
- ✅ Successfully simplified code while preserving accuracy
- ✅ Improved code maintainability and efficiency

## Experiment Cycles

### Baseline (commit: 376fd6ff)
- **Score:** 100.0 (25.0/25.0/25.0/25.0)
- **Status:** Starting point - already optimal from previous sessions

### Cycle 1 (commit: 65bb34a3)
- **Change:** Inline upper variable in normalize_state
  - Reused the `s` variable instead of creating intermediate `upper` variable
  - More concise while maintaining clarity
- **Score:** 100.0 (25.0/25.0/25.0/25.0)
- **Status:** ✅ Keep - maintained perfect score with simpler code

### Cycle 2 (commit: 7ace9454)
- **Change:** Combine strip and sentinel replacement
  - Used method chaining to combine `.str.strip()` and `.replace()` operations
  - More concise and slightly more efficient by avoiding intermediate assignment
- **Score:** 100.0 (25.0/25.0/25.0/25.0)
- **Status:** ✅ Keep - maintained perfect score with cleaner code

## Key Insights

1. **Code Quality Focus:** When score is already optimal, focus shifts to code simplification and maintainability
2. **Incremental Improvements:** Small, focused refactorings are effective for improving code quality without risk
3. **Method Chaining:** Combining related operations through chaining improves readability and reduces temporary variables
4. **Variable Reuse:** Eliminating intermediate variables reduces cognitive load without sacrificing readability

## Code Changes

### Cycle 1: normalize_state() - Inline upper variable
```python
# Before
def normalize_state(state):
    if pd.isna(state) or state == "":
        return ""
    s = str(state).lower()
    if mapped := STATE_MAP.get(s):
        return mapped
    upper = s.upper()
    return upper if len(upper) == 2 and upper in VALID_STATES else ""

# After
def normalize_state(state):
    if pd.isna(state) or state == "":
        return ""
    s = str(state).lower()
    if mapped := STATE_MAP.get(s):
        return mapped
    s = s.upper()
    return s if len(s) == 2 and s in VALID_STATES else ""
```

**Benefits:**
- Fewer variables to track
- More Pythonic (reusing variable for transformation)
- Same performance, cleaner code

### Cycle 2: clean() - Combine strip and sentinel replacement
```python
# Before
for col in df.columns:
    df[col] = df[col].str.strip()
    df[col] = df[col].where(~df[col].isin(SENTINEL_VALUES), "")

# After
for col in df.columns:
    df[col] = df[col].str.strip().replace(list(SENTINEL_VALUES), "")
```

**Benefits:**
- Method chaining is more readable
- Eliminates intermediate assignment
- Slightly more efficient (single operation)

## Conclusion

Successfully completed 2-cycle experiment maintaining the perfect score of 100.0. The data cleaning pipeline is highly optimized, and both cycles focused on code quality improvements that enhance maintainability and efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

The experiment demonstrates that even at optimal performance, there's always value in simplifying code by eliminating redundancies, reducing unnecessary variables, and using more idiomatic Python patterns like method chaining.
